# Polite Programming

## Repo Usage
interpret.py can simply be run on the command line as
```
python3 interpret.py filename
```
and it will interpret the contents of filename.

## Rationale
This is not in any way meant to be a practical or useful languageâ€”rather, something to help me better learn and practice the fundamentals of compilers while inserting at least some humor and entertainment.

## Language Rules
* programs must begin with "hello" and end with "goodbye"
* each command must begin with "please" and end with "thankyou"
* comments begin with "disregard," which will cause the computer to disregard everything until the closing "thankyou"
* variables are assigned with the keyword "call" i.e. to give a the value 1, write "please call a 1 thankyou"
* to print something, use "say" i.e. "say "please say a thankyou"
* for boolean statements,
* for if statements,
* for while loops,
